### Assignments for period 1:

[Introduction to the Full Stack JavaScript](https://github.com/dublo144/fsjs-assignments/tree/master/period_01/01_Intro_To_FSJS)

[Day-2, getting started with node-js
](https://github.com/dublo144/fsjs-assignments/tree/master/period_01/02_Getting-started-with-node)

[Day-3, Promises and async/await](https://github.com/dublo144/fsjs-assignments/tree/master/period_01/03_Promises_Async)

[ES-next, Babel, Typescript and WebPack](https://github.com/dublo144/fsjs-assignments/tree/master/period_01/04_webpack_babel)

**NB:** I freestyled a bit here on the demo assignment. Webpack-configs really comes to power when you can divide them. So in the demo assignment i split the Webpack-configs into [webpack.dev.js](https://github.com/dublo144/fsjs-assignments/blob/master/period_01/04_webpack_babel/webpack-demo/webpack.dev.js), [webpack.prod.js](https://github.com/dublo144/fsjs-assignments/blob/master/period_01/04_webpack_babel/webpack-demo/webpack.prod.js), and [webpack.common.js](https://github.com/dublo144/fsjs-assignments/blob/master/period_01/04_webpack_babel/webpack-demo/webpack.common.js). This allows me to have different settings, depending on the environment.

#### General notes to my start code for Period 2

**_dotEnv_** has been refactored to a dev dependency since it has no use in the production environment. In turn, that means that I can't import it anywhere using `require(dotEnv)`, and I have to preload the config file (.env). This can be done by requiring `-r dotenv/config` in the npm scripts.

**_chai-as-promised_** has been added in order to support testing async code.
Chai-as-promised allows me to `expect` that a function call will rejected, instead of catching the rejected promise and `expect` on that. Better use of the framework. Yay!

**_chai-spies_** has been added in order to support spies on functions. It is used in [GameEndpointTest](https://github.com/dublo144/fsjs-assignments/blob/master/period_02/05_geolocation_geojson_mongodb/test/gameEndpointTest.ts) to verify that the correct function is called in the facade with the correct parameters, without actually asserting on the outcome. The outcome is tested by the unit-test for that function.
