### Assignments for period 1:

[Introduction to the Full Stack JavaScript](https://github.com/dublo144/fsjs-assignments/tree/master/period_01/01_Intro_To_FSJS)

[Day-2, getting started with node-js
](https://github.com/dublo144/fsjs-assignments/tree/master/period_01/02_Getting-started-with-node)

[Day-3, Promises and async/await](https://github.com/dublo144/fsjs-assignments/tree/master/period_01/03_Promises_Async)

[ES-next, Babel, Typescript and WebPack](https://github.com/dublo144/fsjs-assignments/tree/master/period_01/04_webpack_babel)

**NB:** I freestyled a bit here on the demo assignment. Webpack-configs really comes to power when you can divide them. So in the demo assignment i split the Webpack-configs into [webpack.dev.js](https://github.com/dublo144/fsjs-assignments/blob/master/period_01/04_webpack_babel/webpack-demo/webpack.dev.js), [webpack.prod.js](https://github.com/dublo144/fsjs-assignments/blob/master/period_01/04_webpack_babel/webpack-demo/webpack.prod.js), and [webpack.common.js](https://github.com/dublo144/fsjs-assignments/blob/master/period_01/04_webpack_babel/webpack-demo/webpack.common.js). This allows me to have different settings, depending on the environment.
